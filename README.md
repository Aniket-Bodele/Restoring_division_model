# Restoring_division_model
It divides two N-bit numbers with very low time complexity, providing the quotient and remainder in registers Q and A when the 'done' signal is high. In the provided image, I did not use the timescale 1ns/1ps directive, which is why the output is delayed, as it would typically take nanoseconds. In this example, I divided the number 7 by 3.
